   "why_companies_need_dms_h1": "What is a DMS document management system?",
   "why_companies_need_dms_p2": "A document management system (DMS) is software that enables companies to create, store, modify, manage and download digital documents necessary for business. The majority of such software is based on the cloud, which means that company employees can have available, create and change them at any time and in any place. A document management system facilitates the flow of critical information throughout the organization because documents can be shared digitally with all employees in the company.",
   "why_companies_need_dms_h2": "Why does a company need a DMS - document management system?",
   "why_companies_need_dms_p3": "A document management system is an indispensable tool for any type of business nowadays. The first biggest advantage is, of course, reduced paper consumption. Since you can store and share documents digitally in a DMS, paper consumption will be significant reduction and your contribution to environmental protection will increase. There are other advantages of using DMS for your business, and we present some of them below.",
   "why_companies_need_dms_h3": "Secure storage of files and data",
   "why_companies_need_dms_p4": "Most documents related to your business contain key information that you need to access from time to time. Physical documents are always at risk of being lost during storage or transportation, or being damaged due to unforeseen accidents such as fire or flood. S over time, even physical documents wear out and need to be recreated to keep them in good condition. With a document management system, these problems are solved forever. Since there are no physical documents to take care of, you don't have to worry about loss or damage. So , your data cannot be lost unless you want to delete it. Also, with Forspace DMS you can decide who should have access to which document so that all sensitive data will be secure, allowing access only to those people you choose to share it with.",
   "why_companies_need_dms_h4": "Physical documentation is becoming a thing of the past",
   "why_companies_need_dms_p5": "For some jobs, such as accounting and legal issues, this kind of software is a real lifesaver. Instead of having to go through a pile of paper for every little thing, you can simply digitize your documents and trust the leading OCR search to help you find all your files even if they are in read-only formats like images, scans or PDFs.",
   "why_companies_need_dms_h5": "Data is easy to share",
   "why_companies_need_dms_p6": "Communication between employees should be as simple as if they were sitting next to each other. The Forspace DMS system will allow you to quickly, easily and easily share all information and documents with your colleagues so that you will not have to spend time writing e-mails or calling call.",
   "why_companies_need_dms_h6": "Increased productivity in the workplace",
   "why_companies_need_dms_p7": "When a company physically stores its documents, a lot of time and manpower is wasted in the process. Storing and sharing documents becomes a cumbersome process that requires a lot of unnecessary effort. This in turn reduces the overall productivity of employees. Physically searching for a document and then delivering it to the desk of the employee who needs it is a waste of time and resources. A document management system simplifies document retrieval, as it allows employees to access what they need from anywhere through a simple search. Using a DMS, you can easily share a file within seconds with everyone you need. Your employees are freed from the time spent physically searching for files and that time can instead be used more wisely, increasing their productivity.",
   "why_companies_need_dms_h7": "Significant savings",
   "why_companies_need_dms_p8": "Using a document management system also saves you a lot of money. At first it may seem like an investment because you would need to buy software, but the return on investment is also significant. First, you can save a lot on paper and related products. In addition, as employees become more productive by eliminating the traditional file management system, this results in improved efficiency and higher profits.",
   "why_companies_need_dms_h8": "Forspace ERP comes with an integrated management systemwith DMS documents, which enables the storage, archiving and processing of all types of documents. Forspace DMS enables connection between users, fully harmonized data and an overview of the entire business.",

   "why_web_based_p1": " Cloud-based applications have advanced significantly in the past few years and are increasingly used as they enable companies in various industries to create, edit, access and share critical business data. As companies advance, cloud computing is becoming a dominant player for business data in terms of greater security, faster implementation and upgrades, and reduction of total costs. More and more companies are transferring their ERP system to the cloud, and below, find out why this is so.",
   "why_web_based_h1": "Lower setup and implementation costs",
   "why_web_based_p2": "Cloud-based ERP systems have low implementation costs in contrast to the traditional, hosted model. On-premise implementation usually requires significant investment in hardware and professional staff. With cloud-based software, off-site hosting and provider expertise eliminate the need for additional hardware or personnel. Reducing the total cost is the first and key reason why companies switch to cloud-based ERP.",
   "why_web_based_h2": "Flexible data storage",
   "why_web_based_p3": "Additional hardware must be purchased when on-site servers are full. With cloud-based ERP, companies can quickly increase or decrease storage space as needed.",
   "why_web_based_h3": "Easier data backup and restore",
   "why_web_based_p4": "On-premises ERP involves a complex data backup process and usually requires a maintenance plan in SQL Server, plus other products/services. With cloud-based ERP, a regular backup of the system is made daily and is available to users, with the possibility creation of backup copies of users.",
   "why_web_based_h4": "Increased security and scalability",
   "why_web_based_p5": "Local environments are usually less secure and require expensive additional monitoring and a dedicated IT administrator. Data centers owned by Forspace are secure, certified and compliant with international standards. Scalability is the biggest problem with local ERP systems because they are connected to existing hardware capabilities of the enterprise. Cloud-based ERP systems offer scalability options, such as adding new licenses and more users when the company hires new employees. In addition, they provide additional storage space and provide opportunities to accommodate new production processes and facilities .",
   "why_web_based_h5": "Common Data Platform",
   "why_web_based_p6": "Cloud ERP systems provide a common platform where different departments, including manufacturing, sales, marketing, finance and accounting, customer relationship management and supplier relations departments, can share key data anywhere, anytime and on any device. In addition, local solutions are usually more difficult to integrate with other applications than cloud-based solutions.",
   "what_is_api_p1": "The term “API” is used a lot in web development. Updates to the operating system, web browsers, and applications often announce new APIs for developers. So, what is an API and how do developers use it?",
   "what_is_api_h1": "Improved collaboration",
   "what_is_api_p2": "API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface - a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Every time you use an app like Facebook, send a message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API. Purpose API specification is the standardization of data exchange between web services. In this case, standardization means the ability of different systems, written in different programming languages and running on different operating systems, or using different technologies, to seamlessly communicate with each other.",
   "what_is_api_h2": "Easier Innovations",
   "what_is_api_p3": "APIs sit between the application and the web server, acting as an intermediary layer that handles data transfer between the systems.",
   "what_is_api_h3": "Data Monetization",
   "what_is_api_p4": "The functioning of the API can be explained in several steps:",
   "what_is_api_h4": "Additional security",
   "what_is_api_p5": "The client application initiates an API call to retrieve information and this operation is known as a request. This request is processed from the application to the web server via the API's Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and includes a request subject, a header, and sometimes an explanation of the request.",
   "what_is_api_h5": "Common Data Platform",
   "what_is_api_p6": "After receiving a valid request, the API makes a call to an external program orweb server.",
   "what_is_api_p7": "The server sends a response to the API with the requested information.",
   "what_is_api_p8": "The API passes data to the originating application that made the request",
   "what_is_api_p9": "Some of the main benefits of the API include:",
   "what_is_api_p10": "APIs enable the integration of two platforms so that they can seamlessly communicate with each other. Through this integration, companies can automate workflows and improve collaboration in the workplace. Without APIs, many businesses would lack connectivity and suffer from information silos that threaten productivity and performance.",
   "what_is_api_p11": "APIs offer flexibility, enabling companies to connect with new business partners, offer new services in an existing market and, ultimately, access new markets that can generate huge returns and drive digital transformation.",
   "what_is_api_p12": "Many companies choose to offer APIs for free, at least initially, so that they can build an audience of developers around their brand and establish relationships with potential business partners. However, if the API grants access to valuable digital assets, it can be monetized through sales of access (this is called the API economy).",
   "what_is_api_p13": "As stated earlier, APIs create an additional layer of protection between your data and the server. Developers can further strengthen API security by using tokens, signatures, and Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption by implementing an API gateway for managing and authenticating traffic and practicing efficient API management.",
   "digita_trans_adv_p1": "The concept of digital transformation implies the use of digital technologies in a strategic way that simplifies and accelerates your business, from your business model to your internal processes. By digitizing your company, your goal is to gain the benefits of digital transformation, which may include increasing your revenue , improving the user experience and gaining a competitive advantage.",
   "digita_trans_adv_h1": "Improved efficiency",
   "digita_trans_adv_p2": "One of the biggest advantages of implementing an ERP system in your business is a dramatic improvement in efficiency. The way your employees communicate from department to department, the continuous flow of data throughout the organization, the smooth transition from phase to phase during the user's lifetime - all these advantages contribute to a more efficient business process that can save time, money and resources.",
   "digita_trans_adv_h2": "Cost Savings",
   "digita_trans_adv_p3": "With the right ERP software, there are many opportunities to save costs, especially in operational processes.
